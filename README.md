# ES-RNN-TimeSeries-Forecasting
A hybrid time series forecasting project using ES-RNN (Exponential Smoothing Recurrent Neural Network), combining statistical trend modeling with LSTM-based residual learning. Benchmarked on retail sales data and the M3 forecasting competition dataset, and compared against NeuralProphet for performance evaluation.
